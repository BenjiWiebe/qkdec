Simple Motorola Quik-Call II decoder

This simple program will process a raw audio file with the Goertzel algorithm, and look for the tones hard-coded into it.
If it finds the tones, it will return 1 and print a message.

I DO NOT TRUST THIS PROGRAM AS IT NOW STANDS.

I wrote the peak detection code while my brain was foggy, and if it works for you as is, great, but if not, it's not my problem.

Go ahead and use it if you want, just remember that. :)


To convert a wav file to the proper raw format:
	sox input.wav -b 16 -r 8000 out.raw

To convert an ogg file:
	
	sox input.ogg -b 16 -r 8000 out.raw
